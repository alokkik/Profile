### Project
<details>
  
<summary>Fix Simulator</summary>
  
> * Fix simulator is a simulator version of a Stock Exchange
  
> * FIX4.2 protocol used for Server Client communication.
  
> * Client sends NewOrder/Replace Order/Cancel Order request to the server.
  
> * Server processes order requests and send fills to client based on the rule NewOrder has.
  
> * A rule defines how an order should be filled to the client.
  
> * Time based algorithms like TWAP and VWAP were used for time based rules.
  
> * Server has two parallel processes running, one receives order and another process them.
